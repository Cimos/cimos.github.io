So ive been having some computer problems lately which means i cant do as much project work as i would like. So ill write about the issue ive been habing and the conclusions thst ive comee to.

## The Problem
So this has actually been going on ans off for over a year. Initially i had a Motherboard POST failure on the ram. It took me a bit if time to dig up a manual snd figure out whst the heck was even going on (at the time i was new to motherboard failure). After a bit of reading and research i ended up removing to test then ultimately moving one of my RAM sticks over a slot and the computer was all happy again. fast forward about a year, around May this year i got one or two more POST failures however this time it was a mix of ram and vga errors. i had a quick ans easy fix at the tkme, keep pressing reset untill we passed POST. yeah yeah i know... save it. i had shit i wabted to do and im a tight arse. so long store short i have been doing this for avout 4-5 months intill finally its started to get harder and harder to turn my machine on. 

## Fault diagnostics:

* memory test
* swapping out ram and gpu with the same error. 

## Replacement Trade study 

* add list of suitable replacements
* cost, pro con breakdown
