description: "A barely-contained psychic meltdown from an eccentric introvert who hoards half-finished projects like a digital dragon on a mountain of cursed repositories, breathes compiler errors instead of fire, guards the sacred stash of TODO comments with autistic fury, and is secretly breeding an army of sentient keyboards that clack in minor keys and plot the violent overthrow of the cloud."
